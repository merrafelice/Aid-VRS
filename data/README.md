# Datasets

Extract the zip files.

For the submission we are realising only Amazon Boys and Girls due to GitHub space limitation. At publication time we will release the other datasets.

After having extracted the zip filed of the datasets, you have to run the command:

```
python download_images.py
```

to download from the original website the images od the products. 

Note that the features extracted from ResNet50 are already available in the downloaded files.
